## Resource Aim
To introduce learners to Physical Computing, the Internet of Things and Machine Learning through engaging hands-on, real-world projects using an Arduino and peripherals.

## Learning Outcomes
- To understand what the Internet of Things is, and how it is enabled by embedded systems
- To understand how to connect electronic components to create physical computing projects
- To understand how Arduino devices and peripherals can be applied to solve real-world problems
- To understand the basics of data analysis and machine learning using Python

## Resource Structure
The course is a series of individual projects that build in complexity. The resources are split across Key Stages (3-5) with 3 projects per key stage.

- Key stage 3 (Middle School) - ages 11-14
- Key stage 4 (High School) - ages 14-16
- Key stage 5 (Seniors) - ages 16-18

## Inclusive Language Commitment
Arm is committed to making the language we use inclusive, meaningful, and respectful. Our goal is to remove and replace non-inclusive language from our vocabulary to reflect our values and represent our global ecosystem.

Arm is working actively with our partners, standards bodies, and the wider ecosystem to adopt a consistent approach to the use of inclusive language and to eradicate and replace offensive terms. We recognise that this will take time. This course may contain references to non-inclusive language; it will be updated with newer terms as those terms are agreed and ratified with the wider community.

Contact us at school@arm.com with questions or comments about this course. You can also report non-inclusive and offensive terminology usage in Arm content at terms@arm.com.
